# Course Notes for Fourier Analysis

This repository is for hosting the website containing the that I wrote and used for the course in Fourier Analysis that I gave at the Technion.

You can see the site itself [here](https://totallyreal.github.io/Fourier_Notes/notes/Fourier/Motivation).

The code for the original website was forked from [jekyll-gitbook](https://github.com/sighingnow/jekyll-gitbook) by Tao He ([sighingnow](https://github.com/sighingnow/jekyll-gitbook/commits?author=sighingnow)). I made some small updates for my website, and the code together with the markdown files for the notes content can be found at [this repository](https://github.com/TotallyReal/jekyll-gitbook-Fourier).
